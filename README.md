# Reinforcement Learning-Based Autonomous Excavator Control

## Overview

This research focuses on developing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based control method for autonomous operations of a small hydraulic excavator (SANY SY19E), which can autonomously execute a full excavation work cycle consisting of swing, digging, hauling, and dumping tasks.

## Repository Contents

- `/assets`: `.xml` scripts for mechanical modeling based on MuJoCo.
- `/domain_task`: control environment based on DM_Control and task configuration scripts.
- `/matlab_model`: simulink model based on Simscape and scripts for communication between Matlab and Python
- `/test`: scripts for learning MuJoCo and debug
- PPO-based RL implementation, reward functions, and adaptive frequency algorithms.
- `/wrappers`: Scripts for wrapping the simulation environment.
- `/utils`: Helper functions and scripts for simulation. 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- MuJoCo (3.x or later)
- MATLAB Simulink (for hydraulic simulations)
- PyTorch, Stable-Baselines3 (for RL implementation)

Install Python dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- **Start**: use `matlab.engine.shareEngine` in Matlab terminal
- **Training**: run `train_sb3.py`
- **Simulation**: run `show_result.py`
